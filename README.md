**Smart Grass Cutting Robot**
**Overview**

The Smart Grass Cutting Robot is designed to sense and maintain grass height automatically or manually based on user preferences.
It ensures that the grass remains evenly leveled every day, improving lawn maintenance efficiency and reducing human effort.

**Key Features**
Dual Operating Modes

**Manual Mode:**
The user can directly control the robotâ€™s movement and cutting operation through a mobile app.

**Automatic Mode:**
The robot operates independently, following pre-set instructions to sense and cut grass automatically.
The mode can be switched easily through the mobile application.

**Mobile Application Control**
The robot is connected to a mobile app developed using MIT App Inventor (block-based programming).

The app allows users to:
Change between manual and automatic modes.
Control the rack and pinion movement (blade height control).


**Rack and Pinion Mechanism**
The rack and pinion system controls the vertical movement of the cutting blade.
This mechanism is controlled through the same mobile app, both in manual and automatic modes.
